# Quantitative Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing on Height, Weight, and Activity Data

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Individual Project (2021)

This project applied quantitative statistical testing to demographic data (height, weight, physical activity, gender) using a full R project structure for rigorous analysis and reproducibility.

## Key Tasks
- Tested linear relationship between height and weight (regression)  
- Compared mean height between males and females (t-test)  
- Examined association between gender and activity (chi-square)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical hypothesis testing (regression, t-test, chi-square)  
- R project structure and reproducible computation  
- Quantitative data analysis and validation  
- Empirical statistical modelling  

## Submission Details
- Complete R project folder structure preserved for reproducibility  
- **vignettes/articles/** folder serves as the main documentation and reporting location: contains original R Markdown source (STATProject.Rmd), rendered HTML/PDF, bibliography, and all analysis code/results in a structured, reproducible format.  
- Unzip or browse folders (R/, data/, tests/, vignettes/, etc.) for full project access.
